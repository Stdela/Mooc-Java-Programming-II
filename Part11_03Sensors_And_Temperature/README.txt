Standard sensor
Create a class called StandardSensor that implements the interface Sensor.

A standard sensor is always on. Calling the methods setOn and setOff have no effect. The StandardSensor must have a constructor that takes one integer parameter. 
The method call read returns the number that was given to the constructor.

TemperatureSensor
Create a class TemperatureSensor that implements the Sensor interface.

At first a temperature sensor is off. When the method read is called and the sensor is on, the sensor randomly chooses an integer in the range -30...30 and returns it. If the sensor is off, the method read throws an IllegalStateException.

Use the ready-made Java class Random to choose the random number. You'll get an integer in the range 0...60 by calling new Random().nextInt(61); â€” to get a random integer in the range -30...30 you'll have to subtract a suitable number from the random number in the range 0...60.

verage sensor
Create a class called AverageSensor that implements the interface Sensor.

An average sensor includes multiple sensors. 
In addition to the methods defined in the Sensor interface, 
the AverageSensor has the method public void addSensor(Sensor toAdd) that can be used to add a new sensor for the average sensor to control.

An AverageSensor is on when all its sensors are on. When setOn is called, all the sensors must be set on. 
When setOff is called, at least one of the sensors must be set off. It's also acceptable to set off all the sensors.

The method read of AverageSensor returns the average of the read methods of its sensors (since the return value is int, 
the number is rounded down as is the case with integer division). If this method is called while the AverageSensor is off, or if no sensors have been added to it, 
the method should throw an IllegalStateException.
